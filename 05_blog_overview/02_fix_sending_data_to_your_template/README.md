You added an `topics` view to the learning log app that should display the a list of all your learning log topics. However, there's no data showing up.

<div class='alert alert-info' role='alert'>
    <strong>Info:</strong> You can either create new data or copy the <code>db.sqlite3</code> file from the previous exercise and work with the data you inputted there.
</div>

### Your Task

Find out why the `Topic` data is not properly passed forward to your template, as well as why there's nothing being displayed on the page. You will have to fix missing pieces in two files to get this to work as expected.
