# Fix The Django Flow

[This Django Project](https://github.com/CodingNomads/django-web-dev/tree/master/03_understand_django/web-dev-assignments/01_fix-django-flow) should display a short message when navigating to `http://localhost:8000`, however, it currently doesn't work.

Put on your detective glasses and follow the **Django Flow** from the browser through all relevant files in the webapp, and fix any issues that you come across.

Your task is complete when the URL mentioned above displays a simple message in the browser.
