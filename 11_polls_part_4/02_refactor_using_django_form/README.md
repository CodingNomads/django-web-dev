### Django Twitter Clone

This is an application that models the basic functionality of Twitter.
It allows:

* user creation
* posting short text messages
* following and unfollowing other users
* inspecting a 'feed' of messages from users that a user follows

### Your Tasks: Implement Possible Improvements

* Create a view that allows to see all users on the platform
* Create a search to look for users according to username
* Remove the `Add Djeet` sidebar when viewing another user's profile
* Replace the input form with Django Forms
