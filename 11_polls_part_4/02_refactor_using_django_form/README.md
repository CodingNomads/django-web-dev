# Attention: Half-Finished Bonus Lab!!

**Important Note:** This is a stub lab that hasn't (yet) been finished all the way. This is why it's also not part of the official course content that you'll find in the CodingNomads Django course on the learning platform.

The idea of this lab is to give you practice working with **Django Forms** instead of pure HTML forms. If you're up for the challenge, expect to run into some rough edges. Consulte the [official API documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/forms/) and the official tutorial on [working with forms](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/forms/#forms-in-django).

## Django Twitter Clone

This is an application that models the basic functionality of Twitter.
It allows:

* user creation
* posting short text messages
* following and unfollowing other users
* inspecting a 'feed' of messages from users that a user follows

## Your Tasks: Refactor to Use Django Forms

Replace the HTML input form with a [Django Form](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/forms/).

Like mentioned above, there might be quite some work to do to get this to click. This is bonus material, so if you get frustrated and would prefer to move on, then go ahead. You can always come back later on, if you want to.

## Potential Further Improvements

The Djitter project could use many additional improvements, for example:

* Upgrade the project to a modern version of Django
* Create a view that allows to see all users on the platform
* Create a search to look for users according to username
* Remove the `Add Djeet` sidebar when viewing another user's profile

As you can see, your work as a web developer is never done...
