# Fix Missing Style

Your boss told you that they found [this project online](https://github.com/CodingNomads/django-web-dev/tree/master/03_understand_django/web-dev-assignments/03_fix-missing-style) and it should look nice and modern, however, currently it looks... messy! They say that they expect it to look like below, and that you have exactly 1 hour to prove your worth:

You decide that working in a toxic environment like that isn't worth it and that you can do much better and put in your one-day-notice. However, because you're a nice person, you still go ahead and apply the necessary **style fix**.

Your task is complete when the page displays styled like in the example picture above.
