You cloned a "Learning Log" project from a friend of yours and want to use the app to keep track of your learning process. The app seems functional, but it doesn't have a database file and therefore comes without any data.

You just learned about adding database entries through the Django Shell and want to make an entry to your new learning log app: **through the Django Shell**!

### Your Task

Inspect the models in `learning_logs/models.py` to understand the database structure. Then open up your Django Shell and create two new topic with two associated entries each:

- **Topic**: Django Shell
    -   How to enter the Django Shell
    -   How to add an entry via the Django Shell
- **Topic**: Some Topic You Learned About
    -   Interesting Fact #1
    -   Interesting Fact #2

Feel free to add more entries and use this app to _actually_ record your learning progress. :)

    <strong>Info:</strong> Entering Data through the shell is tedious, but still worth training! After you have entered the two topics and their entries through the shell, you could challenge yourself and see whether you can set up the Django Admin interface for this app to make future data entry easier.
