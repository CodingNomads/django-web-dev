You _nearly_ fixed the webapp, but something got in the way (Okay uncle Jack, I'm gonna come over for a second and help you pickle those mushrooms...). So you had to abandon the project for the time being. Fast-forward two months into the future, you remember you promised to fix up this project and dive back into the code. Luckily you left some code comments in `views.py`.

### Your Task

Navigate to `views.py` and interpret the code comment you left two months ago. Don't remember leaving the code comment? Well, time travel can mess with your mind, don't say that popular media didn't warn you! Also, it's easy to forget all the code you worked on before, so lucky that you _did_ leave a comment! ; )

Fix up the app so that you can successfully fetch single database entries from the database. Make sure that it also handles edge cases, e.g. that it doesn't return an error when someone enters an unexpected input.
