Your friend wants to show off their projects in a **portfolio site** and built out a webapp with Django. It was working fine at the beginning, but for some reason everything went wrong when adding the **detail** pages for a project... :/

### Your Task

With your vast knowledge of **capturing path components** and knowing how it all connects together, you're just the right person to help a friend in need! Fix the issues in their code to make sure that:

- Detail pages of projects can be displayed
- The buttons on the main page successfully redirect to the individual detail pages

There are a couple of files you need to check out and fix up. Keep checking back in the course materials if you get lost. You got this :)
